# Originals
A Rimworld 1.3 spinoff of the Immortals (Highlander) mod by fridgeBaron, with a few key mechanical differences. Similar to immortality mechanics in TVD and Originals TV Series, immortality is now based on the heart, which is linked to blood. Staking an Original slows down their immortality and ability to resurrect, and destruction of the heart is key to finishing off an Original for good. A dead immortal releases a shockwave, and other lucky immortals in the area will be able to absorbe their power and increase their own Originality, possibly increasing their resurrection powers as well.

**Categories**

Mortal: Lowest tier of Original, those who have just enough original blood flowing through their blood to trigger a transformation into a lowblooded Original on their death. However, no one knows they're immortal until they face death for the first time, as they exhibit no special healing or regrowing properties.

Lowblood: All mortals with Original abilities become a lowblood after their first death. They have healing abilities far greater than any mortal, but are still susceptible to losing body parts, such are arms or legs. They no longer fear the wrath of old age, as their powers negate all negative effects of time.

Fullblood: A "standard" being with Original powers, has faster healing powers than lowblooded Originals, and also have the ability to regenerate body parts, such as limbs, though at the cost of large amounts of pain.

Highblood: Much improved healing powers, and resurrection is faster compared to Fullblooded Originals.

Original: Someone who was either descended directly from the Originals themselves, or who have killed so many other Originals that their power has increased to unfathomable levels. These beings have blazing fast resurrection, regeneration, and healing times, and are nearly impossible to best without an army against them.



**Technical Stuff**

This mod does not utilize GameComponent as the main driver for immortality, but instead uses ThingComp and patches all humanoid races (with exceptions for androids and mechanical pawns). This method should be credited to Neronix17's Celestial Mod, a lightweight resurrection mod. Still, I felt it was a bit light and wanted to add more in depth stuff like healing wounds while dead and a staking mechanic.

No, this is not a full vampire + immortality mod. Why? I am not Jecrell, I'm but a novice modder who makes up for lack of skill with a lot of time. The only reason I got this far is because I wanted something like the highlanders Immortal mod for 1.3, but didn't want to wait. Therefore, here we are, a fully functional resurrection mod to allow you to keep pawns close to your heart alive, forever.
