# Originals
A Rimworld 1.3 spinoff of the Immortals (Highlander) mod by fridgeBaron, with a few key mechanical differences. Similar to immortal mechanics in TVD and Originals TV Series, immortality is now based on the heart, which is linked to blood. Staking an Original slows down their immortality and ability to resurrect, and destruction of the heart is key to finishing off an immortal for good.


**Technical Stuff**
This mod does not utilize GameComponent as the main driver for immortality, but instead uses ThingComp and patches all humanoid races (with exceptions for androids and mechanical pawns). This method should be credited to Neronix17's Celestial Mod, a lightweight resurrection mod. Still, I felt it was a bit light and wanted to add more in depth stuff like healing wounds while dead and a staking mechanic.
